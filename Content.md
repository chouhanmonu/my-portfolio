# About

- [image]
- About: Hi! I'm Monu
  I am a senior full-stack developer from the outskirts of Mumbai.
  After starting my career as a junior web developer, I soon began working on entire apps, understanding client needs, and collaborating as part of a team with problem-solving in mind.
  I strongly believe that with the right use of technology, we can make our lives significantly better.
  I ❤️ going on adventurous trips, listening to music, learning, and reading!
